Threading:
The point/path of execution is called thread, ie, main()

MultiThreading:

Test->new MyThread()->start()->Thread(Start)->MyThread->run()

To change name of the thread : Thread.setName(String name);
To get name of the thread : Thread.getName();
To find the name of the Thread class imported : Thread.getClass().getName();
To get the priority of the Thread: Thread.getPriority();
so jave provides 0 to 10 for priority. here 0 means less priority and 10 means higher priority
Java bydefault gives priority number 5 for every thread.
Once the thread is started, we cann't start it once again, otherwise we will get runtime exception saying "IlligalStateException"
We shall not use run() for thread execution because we will not get thread advantage


Runnable() interface:
For implementing interface, thread has introduced one interface which is called 
Runnable(), it consists only one method called run();
